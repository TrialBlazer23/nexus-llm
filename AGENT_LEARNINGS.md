# Agent Learnings

This file is a concise, append-only record of durable lessons from development,
debugging, validation, and research. It is intended to help future contributors
avoid repeating known mistakes.

## Entry guidelines

- Record bugs, failed commands, environment-specific behavior, research findings,
  and important design decisions that are likely to matter again.
- Include the context, observed finding, resulting action, and verification status.
- Prefer facts and reproducible details over narrative or speculation.
- Update an existing entry when new evidence clarifies it; otherwise add entries
  in reverse chronological order.
- Never include credentials, tokens, secrets, personal data, or sensitive output.
